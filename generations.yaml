    description: "The original GMC Safari was a rear-wheel drive midsize van developed alongside the nearly identical Chevrolet Astro. Built on a dedicated truck-based platform with body-on-frame construction, it offered more ruggedness and capability than the front-wheel drive minivans that were becoming popular at the time. Available in cargo and passenger configurations, with the latter offering seating for up to eight passengers across three rows. Power came from various V6 engines, starting with a 4.3L carbureted version and evolving to fuel-injected variants with improved output. All-wheel drive became available in 1990, enhancing the Safari's versatility and capability in adverse conditions. The interior was functional rather than luxurious, with a focus on durability and practicality. This generation established the Safari as a versatile workhorse that bridged the gap between traditional full-size vans and more car-like minivans."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The second-generation Safari featured a comprehensive redesign with more modern styling, including a longer front end with improved crash protection. Mechanically similar to its predecessor, it maintained the rugged body-on-frame construction and rear-wheel drive (or optional all-wheel drive) layout. Powered by an updated 4.3L Vortec V6 engine paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, it offered good towing capability for a vehicle of its size. The interior was significantly improved with better ergonomics, materials, and optional features including power accessories, enhanced audio systems, and rear air conditioning. Safety features were expanded to include driver and eventually passenger airbags, anti-lock brakes, and later optional side airbags. Though increasingly dated compared to more modern minivan designs, the Safari maintained a loyal following among those who valued its towing capability, durability, and available all-wheel drive. Production ended in 2005 without a direct replacement as GM shifted focus to full-size vans and crossover SUVs."
